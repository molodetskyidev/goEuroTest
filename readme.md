GoEuro lists the travel results sorted by smartest, cheapest, fastest or by time
(departure/arrival). Please create an automated test that will make a search between Berlin
and Prague and will verify that the sorting by price is correct. The test should be done using
either Java or Javascript, using open source tools.
We’ll take a look at your solution considering if the test is working, the design choices, the
commit messages on github (best practices of version control), the test report and the
README file. Please also explain your technology and approach choices.
Constraints:
We’ll only accept solutions with a github link.
Keep in mind that the test should be ready to run either in Linux or OS X only.
